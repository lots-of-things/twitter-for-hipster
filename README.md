  Twitter for Hipster
</h1>

Memes and other idle distractions tend to be super popular on Twitter.  I'm a grumpy hipster so I don't want to see any of that.

<h6>This browser extension removes any tweets that have more than 1000 likes or retweets.</h6>

It's not perfect. If somebody retweets something really popular, but adds their own dumb little inoccuous comment to it then, yeah, that'll still show up.

I based it off [Thomas Wang](https://twitter.com/ThomasWang)'s [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/thomaswang/minimal-twitter), which minimalizes my Twitter experience and is also an essential twitter add-on for any good hipster on Twitter.

## Installation

I haven't put this on the firefox or chrome webstores yet, (I'm a hipster, remember, I can't even be bothered). But it can still be installed on Firefox and Chrome manually if you want to try it out.

## Developing

Feel free to clone/fork this repository and extend it to your ❤️'s delight. This is just my personal hipterization, but I'm open to extensions that remove all the banal stuff from my timeline.
